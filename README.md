Inspiration from https://www.reddit.com/r/reactnative/comments/md8xi7/building_broken_funny_ui_with_reanimated_2_and/

### Features include

- Text inputs affected by weight
- Button with detection of which side is pressed
- Animations (rotating on point, sliding text, falling)

### Key packages

- [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated) (Input & Button animations)
- [lottie-react-native](https://github.com/lottie-react-native/lottie-react-native) (Explosion animation)

### Learnings
- New reanmiated settings (i.e easing, etc.)
- Changing the anchor point of a component (when transformOrigin is not available) by using multiple X/Y transforms with rotation in between
- Lottie is very cool
